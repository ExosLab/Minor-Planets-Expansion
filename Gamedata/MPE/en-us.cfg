		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Archae_displayName = Archae^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Archae_description = Archae is the small moon of Ervo. Not much about Archae is known as its existence only recently came into the category of "things the Kerbal Astronomical Society are pretty sure exist." The reason for this is a result of its dark coloration, giving it the rank of "things the Kerbal Astronomical Society think are ominous."

        #LOC_MPE_Planets_Crokslev_displayName = Crokslev^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Crokslev_description = Crokslev is the largest known "centaur," a class of asteroids that wander around the orbits of the outer planets, and do so choatically. Not much is known about 11909 Crokslev, its neighboring planets are far more attractive to sight-seeing astronomers. However, the recent discovery of rings around this object made headlines, and astronomers are starting to occasionally glance at this unassuming dot.

        #LOC_MPE_Planets_Edas_displayName = 433 Edas^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Edas_description = Edas is a very small, stony asteroid. It's been noted as a potential destination for robotic explorers, maybe for a brief visit on the way someplace further out. Edas is unthreatening enough that it has been suggested as a fun place to send Kerbals for a brief bit of camping practice.

        #LOC_MPE_Planets_Ervo_displayName = Ervo^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Ervo_description = Ervo is a massive object in the outer reaches of the system. Ervo's discovery and size, comparable to other objects in its region, ultimately led to the creation of the term "dwarf planet." Numerous fight-related injuries are now directly tied to Ervo's existence. Ervo's nature leaves few unpuzzled: its tenuous atmosphere has an usually high concentration of oxygen, and "why" is a matter of considerable debate. In fact, the conditions could be suitable for stable pools of liquid oxygen to exist on Ervo's surface. Any such "LOx lakes" would be highly chemically reactive, and potentially incredibly dangerous... but what are the chances of such a thing existing in nature anyway?

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Flake_displayName = Flake^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Flake_description = Flake is a very small moon around Mracksis. Despite its small size the moon was discovered on the first major telescope observations of Mracksis due to its incredibly high albedo, next to its parent’s rather dim coloring. It is suspected that Flake is covered in a layer of “fresh powder” but the origins of such powders if they do exist is unknown.

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Geito_displayName = 1P-Geito^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Geito_description = Geito is the exact object that comes to the average Kerbal's mind when they think of a comet. They think of brilliant streaks across the night sky, and most would be surprised to hear that comets are in reality small chunks of ice. Despite its small size Geito, which was named after its discoverer, is actually one of the largest comets known.

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Havous_displayName = Havous^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Havous_description = Havous is an attention-grabber. Every new discovery relating to Havous seem make the clear point that Havous is a very unusual world. From its squished shape, tight rings, and a strikingly blue patch, Havous has more referred to as "The Deep Space Jewel."

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Kal_displayName = Kal^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Kal_description = Kal is a lumpy little moon that hangs out near the rings of Havous. The bright rings, and equally bright Havous, made it difficult to spot the small moon. Never the less, Kal was discovered and given a very important almost-footnote in the morning newspaper.

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Ki'Ki_displayName = Ki'Ki^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Ki'Ki_description = Ki'Ki was the first moon known to orbit Havous, its orbit seems to suggest it was captured. There is debate in the planetary science community on the nature of Ki'Ki's origin. Some say Ki'Ki formed from the rings of Havous and migrated outwards, however the more widely accepted answer is that Ki'Ki was once a comet. If Ki'Ki is an ex-comet, it should be signifantly easier to chase down than the others; although, it's not exactly nearby.

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Lint-Mikey_displayName = 68P-Lint/Mikey^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Lint-Mikey_description = Lint Kerman discovered an object wondering in an elliptical orbit, and reported that it *could* be a comet, though not nearly as impressive as Geito's. The object's existence was confirmed by Mikey Kerman, who also confirmed its cometary nature when he observed a small coma around the object. The object now bares both of their names, and was the first short-period comet ever discovered. Due to its (relatively) close nature many agencies believe that it may be a good target, it has been warned however that microgravity may make navigation around it difficult.

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Lon_displayName = Lon^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Lon_description = Lon is the very lonely moon of a very lonely dwarf. Its discovery is deemed a miracle due its distance and small size. Astronomers, but more commonly astrologists, take comfort in the notion that Soden is <color=#b3afd6>not entirely alone out there.</color>

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Mracksis_displayName = Mracksis^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Mracksis_description = Mracksis is a very red dwarf planet living around the same region of space as Havous. The vibrant red coloration is the result of tholins building up on the surface. The reason why Mracksis possesses such a high global concentration of tholins, while Havous does not, is a mystery. Unfortunately Mracksis does not get the same amount of attention as other objects in its neighborhood.
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Mracksis_descriptionAlt = Mracksis is a particularly red dwarf planet. The vibrant red coloration is the result of tholins building up on the surface. The reason why Mracksis possesses such a high global concentration of tholins, while other objects do not, is a mystery. Unfortunately Mracksis does not get the same amount of attention as other distant objects, missions to this region take years to travel, perhaps now is the time to finally send a visitor?

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Soden_displayName = Soden^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Soden_description = Soden marks the boldest ambitions of many space programs. It's the furthest frontier that could ever be hoped to reach with current technologies, and it's not going to stick around for long. The small, lonely dwarf floats out beyond even Ervo. It's said that from this distant vantage point, our home is but a pale dot.

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Vant_displayName = Vant^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Vant_description = Vant is the largest asteroid in the entire solar system, and the basis by which the Alphabetic Asteroid Classification System (AACS) was made, quite controversially, with Vant being the exclusive member of the "V-Class" asteroids. Vant seems to be mainly made up of ice, suggesting it did not form in the warmer region it lives in today. Vant has been proposed as a main target in an "asteroid belt grand tour" mission multiple times.

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Zore_displayName = Zore^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Zore_description = Zore is one of the most massive objects in the main asteroid belt. Zore's small size and high mass has lead to the conclusion that Zore is mostly made of metal, making it the largest metallic asteroid known in the entire system. It's been concluded that Zore may be the core of a protoplanet that was shattered early in the solar system's history. Though scientists can only speculate what that young planet Zore came from may have been like, most agree it's a shame that they can't identify the other parts of it.
