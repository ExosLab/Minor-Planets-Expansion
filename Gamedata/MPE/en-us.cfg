		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Archae_displayName = Archae^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Archae_description = Archae is the small moon of Ervo. Not much about Archae is known as its existence only recently came into the category of "things the Kerbal Astronomical Society are pretty sure exist." The reason for this is a result of its dark coloration, giving it the rank of "things the Kerbal Astronomical Society think are ominous."

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Crokslev_displayName = Crokslev^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Crokslev_description = Crokslev is the largest member of the "centaurs," a group of asteroids that wander around the orbits of the outer planets. Not much is known about Crokslev, as most would rather consider Sarnus or Urlum for missions, both of which are not far from Crokslev. However, the recent discovery of rings around this object gave it several headlines and now the scientific community is starting to bat an eye towards the large, icy asteroid.

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Edas_displayName = 433 Edas^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Edas_description = Edas is a very small, stony, Duna-crossing asteroid. It's been noted as a potential destination for missions robotic that have expended their usefulness at Duna, a midway pitstop on the way to the outer kerbolar system, or as a stopping point in an asteroid-grand-tour.

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Ervo_displayName = Ervo^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Ervo_description = Ervo is the most massive known object beyond the orbit of Neidon. Its discovery and size, comparable to Plock's, ultimately led to the demotion of Plock to a dwarf planet. Numerous fight-related injuries are now directly tied to Ervo's existence. Ervo has a tenuous atmosphere with a heavy concentration of oxygen. There is considerable debate over the origin of this oxygen, whether Ervo has life or is simply oversaturated is a question that could only be answered with a visit. The conditions are also suitable for liquid oxygen to exist on the surface, but what are the chances of that?

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Flake_displayName = Flake^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Flake_description = Flake is a very small moon around Mracksis. Despite its small size the moon was discovered on the first major telescope observations of Mracksis due to its incredibly high albedo, next to its parent’s rather dim coloring. It is suspected that Flake is covered in a layer of “fresh powder” but the origins of such powders if they do exist is unknown.

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Geito_displayName = 1P-Geito^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Geito_description = Geito is the exact object that comes to the average Kerbal's mind when they think of a comet. They think of brilliant streaks across the night sky, and most would be surprised to hear that comets are in reality small chunks of ice. Despite its small size Geito, which was named after its discoverer, is actually one of the largest comets known.

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Havous_displayName = Havous^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Havous_description = Havous was originally referred to as Plock's sister. This, however, is no longer the case. Every new discovery relating to Havous seemed to further make the point clear that Havous was a very unusual world indeed. From its squished shape, tight rings, and blue patch, Havous has more recently been called the "trans-neidonian jewel."

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Kal_displayName = Kal^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Kal_description = Kal is a lumpy little moon that hangs out near the rings of Havous. The bright rings, and equally bright Havous, made it difficult to spot the small moon. Never the less, Kal was discovered and given a very important almost-footnote in the morning newspaper.

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Ki'Ki_displayName = Ki'Ki^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Ki'Ki_description = Ki'Ki was the first moon known to orbit Havous, its orbit seems to suggest it was captured. There is debate in the planetary science community on the nature of Ki'Ki's origin. Some say Ki'Ki formed from the rings of Havous and migrated outwards, however the more widely accepted answer is that Ki'Ki was once a comet. If Ki'Ki is an ex-comet, it should be signifantly easier to chase down than the others; although, it's not exactly nearby.

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Lint-Mikey_displayName = 68P-Lint/Mikey^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Lint-Mikey_description = Lint Kerman discovered an object wondering in an elliptical orbit which took it out past Jool. The object was confirmed by Mikey Kerman, who also discovered a small coma around the object. The object now bares both of their names, and was the first short-period comet ever discovered. Due to it's (relatively) close nature many agencies believe that it may be a good target for exploration, at least robotically. It has been warned however that microgravity may make navigation difficult.

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Lon_displayName = Lon^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Lon_description = Lon is the very lonely moon of a very lonely dwarf. Its discovery is deemed a miracle due its distance and small size. Astronomers, but more commonly astrologists, take comfort in the notion that Soden is <color=#b3afd6>not entirely alone out there.</color>

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Mracksis_displayName = Mracksis^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Mracksis_description = Mracksis is a very red dwarf planet living around the same region of space as Havous. The vibrant red coloration is the result of tholins building up on the surface. The reason why Mracksis possesses such a high global concentration of tholins, while objects like Plock or Havous do not, is a mystery. Unfortunately Mracksis does not get the same amount of attention as other objects beyond Neidon, missions to this region take years to travel, perhaps now is the time to finally send a visitor?

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Soden_displayName = Soden^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Soden_description = Soden marks the boldest ambitions of Kerbin's space programs. It's the furthest frontier that could ever be hoped to reach with current technologies, and it's not going to stick around for long. The small, lonely dwarf floats out beyond even Ervo. It's said that from this distant vantage point, Kerbin is a pale blue dot.

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Vant_displayName = Vant^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Vant_description = Vant is the largest asteroid in the entire solar system, and the basis by which the alphabetic asteroid classification system (AACS) was made,  quite controversially, with Vant being the exclusive member of the "V-Class" asteroids. Vant itself is about half Dres' radius, and is considered by some to be Dres' "little sister." Unlike Dres however, Vant seems to be mainly made up of ice, though it's difficult to prove this from Kerbin. Vant has been proposed as a main target in an "asteroid belt grand tour" mission multiple times.

                #LOC_MPE_Planets_Zore_displayName = Zore^N
		#LOC_MPE_Planets_Zore_description = Zore is one of the most massive objects in the main asteroid belt. Zore's small size and high mass has lead to the conclusion that Zore is mostly made of metal, making it the largest metallic asteroid known in the entire system. It's been concluded that Zore may be the core of a protoplanet that was shattered early in the solar system's history. Though scientists can only speculate what that young planet Zore came from may have been like, most agree it's a shame that they can't identify the other parts of it.
