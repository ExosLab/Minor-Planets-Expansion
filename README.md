To install MPE, move the MPE folder you downloaded into KSP's Gamedata folder, as with any other mod!
To swap language to Russian, replace the en-us.cfg folder within MPE's main folder with the ru.cfg which can be found within the Localizations folder.
The license, README, THANK YOU!!.txt, and the Localizations folder itself are not necessary to MPE's functionality.

The Nereid folder, also found in the download, contains ribbons for use with Nereid's Final Frontier mod, which gives Kerbals badges for their achievements. This support was created by forum user @hemeac!
Special thank you to forum users @Coolguybest, @IIodyne, and @InterplanetJanet for additional support with bugfixes and additional features over the years!



An explaination on MPE's new **BONUS CONTENT**:
MPE has been given some ADDITIONAL, OPTIONAL FEATURES, for use alongside it!
Think of them as additional mini-mods!

These mini-mods are stored in self-contained folders within MPE's main Gamedata folder.
Simply navigate to MPE/Bonus and remove what you do not wish to include.
At this time, MPE contains three bonus packs:
- JoolRings (Adds a thin ring around Jool, similar to Jupiter's)
